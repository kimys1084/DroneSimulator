#[Quadcopter Simulation in Python]

The project simulates a quadcopter in 3D environment. It contains a basic quadcopter dynamcis model, hover controller, trajectory generator, visulization toolkit

To Run
-----
require OPENGL PYGAME and NUMPY. You can simply run the following:
``` 
make
python runsim.py
``` 

Future Work
-----

* Kalman filter based sensor fusion: height estimation by accelerometer and barometer.

Contribution
